- Decode
     - Verified to work correctly
     - Found that these registers are also incorrectly edge triggered
- Operand Access
     - Working on currently
     - Looks like instruction registers are triggered on wrong (opposite) edge
     - This is odd since the code is the same as the decode module

- Switched all clocks in control path registers only
