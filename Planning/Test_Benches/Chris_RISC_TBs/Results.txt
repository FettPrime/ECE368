- Decode
     - Verified to work correctly
     - Found that these registers are also incorrectly edge triggered
- Operand Access
     - Working on currently
     - Looks like instruction registers are triggered on wrong (opposite) edge
     - This is odd since the code is the same as the decode module
     - Displayed in OpAcc_Test1.PNG

- Switched all clocks in control path registers only

- believe that register bank is storing junk values too soon
	- possible enable signals in control path

- write back
	- wb_instout <= wB_inst;
	- wb_instout <= wF_inst;

- write back plus one
	-  added  two register state to match timing issues
